Meeting Notes 9/27/2010

Quick checks and assignments

 * Everybody got their GForge accounts and tested it
 * Progressively transfer Wiki stuff from chameleon's gforge account
 * We have to organize a mini reading club:
    * Present either on Weekly meetings on Monday or Wednesdays, as needed
    * One of the team reads a paper
    * Short presentation and to the point
    * No slides are needed -- presentations will be done on the whiteboard.
    * A short summary/overview of the paper should be placed on the Wiki

Alkis' VLDB Report

 * People from Brown presented CORADD paper
 * Ragu Ramakrishnan:
    * He's now at Yahoo! and leads the Community Systems group.
    * He's reengineering their cloud so that instead of having overlapping components, they define 
      and specify a set of non-overlapping ones, that can be assembled together to create a 
      'solution' or service for a customer. In this way they can focus their efforts efficiently 
      (pretty much like OO programming counterpart)
    * In this scenario they want to have a set of properties that the user selects, like an 
      abstraction layer between the user and his/her needs and this components/services available on 
      the Cloud.
    * For example, in the case of Amazon, they have many options like E2,S3,Map/Reduce,etc.
    * So an idea that emerges from the above is to have a 'Cloud Service Configuration Advisor':
       * Given a workload and data, what's the best Cloud Service Configuration in terms of 
         performance and cost (and maybe more)
  * There was also a discussion on NoSQL vs Relational.
     * "Who are the users that really need that kind of processing/scalability power? Besides Google 
       and Facebook, who else is there? Should that be a concern to the academic DB people? Is it 
       worth to expend too much time on Map/Reduce in terms of the research? In order to answer these 
       questions it may be useful to respond to these questions: What does their data look like?  
       What about their queries?" -Surajit Chauduri

Dagstuhl's Robust Query Processing Workshop
http://www.dagstuhl.de/no_cache/en/program/calendar/semhp/?semnr=10381
 * On one of the sessions, the group discussed about the importance of having more aids to give the 
   DBA an essential piece of information that currently is hard to deliver:
     * "How do you explain to the DBA in a clear concise way how a configuration will affect a given 
       workload?"
     * This essentially is the topic of one of our research project: UI for SATuning.
 * There was also the topic of experimentation. How do we test distinct configurations? Given a 
   system that has been running, how do we pick a representative workload?

Technical
 * Eventually our code will be open to the community, so we need to have a robust set of tests
 * November 1st is the deadline for a demo SIGMOD, which is very soon but we should focus on it.
 * By the end of the quarter, we should have a stable version of the Foundation Library and PGs 
   extensions
 * We should define milestones and deliverables in terms of this deadline.
 * We should focus on the Foundation Library and PG extensions before doing any kind of extension 
   (like a Console or UI one).
 * Later, we should eventually incorporate our PG extensions to the PG main trunk, in order to have 
   an easy way of 'upgrading' to latest versions of the DBMS.

To-dos:
 * Ivo will read the CORADD paper and will put it on the Wiki along with a classification and 
   overview of it
 * Jeff will read and give a little presentation on Divergent Indexes
 * Huascar and Ivo will start to write tests for Karl's Java Code
 * Huascar and Ivo will check Karl's Postgres code and try to recreate Karl's environment.
 * Start to thinking about tests for Postgres code
 * Huascar will give a short report on the features implemented by Karl, so that we can decide what to keep for the first software release.
 * Huascar and Ivo will give a demo on the interactive index tuning shell developed at MSR (by Nico Bruno and Surajit Chaudhuri).
