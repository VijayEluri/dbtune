Work summary for 2010-11-01
- attended weekly work-summary meeting (last week was a virtual meeting)
- created new package structure: edu.ucsc.dbtune, edu.ucsc.dbtune.sat, edu.ucsc.dbtune.core.
- wrote on the wiki how to use Caliper (Google's Microbenchmarking framework).
- Fixed Stack & Queue's memory leak.
- continue working on db-package.
  - checked-in db-package updated/cleaned up code(Trunk)
  - wrote many unit tests targeting that package's functionality.
  - fixed bugs discovered after unit writing/executing new unit tests.
- worked on the Index Benefit Graph (ibg) package.
  - wrote unit tests that exercise some of the existing use cases
  - cleaned up code.
  - checked-in ibg-package updated/cleaned up code(Trunk)
- move db-package & ibg-package(including tests) changes to the new package structure.
  - commit these changes to Trunk.
- read SATuning 2011 SIGMOD paper.
- Notes:
  - even though the updated/cleaned code has been checked-in, we need more unit tests. Therefore,
    I will try to spend 1/2 hr, probably every 2 days, to include more tests.
  - There are classes under the engine package that are only used by the classes under the ibg 
    package. Therefore, they should be cleaned up and then moved to edu.ucsc.dbtune.sat package.
    This is not a major change. Therefore it will affect any functionality under the ibg-package. 
    Having written that, I can start cleaning up and then moving these classes to dbtune.sat 
    little by little.
