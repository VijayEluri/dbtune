Work summary for 2010-10-13
- worked on changing the Satuning's DB type hierarchy (I've made good progress). I am expenting to check
  these changes in the next 2 or 3 days (after adding the appropriate unit tests).
  - summary of changes:
    1. moved dbms-connection-specific functionality (e.g., DBConnection#open(.....) away from
       the DBConnection type. Now there is a new type called DatabaseConnectionManager that handles
       that responsibility.
    2. moved optimization-specific functionality (e.g., DBConnection#whatIfOptimize(...),
       DBConnection#recommendIndexes(...), and many more) away from DBConnection type. Now there
       is a new type called DatabaseIndexExtractor (one per dbms-specific connection) which will
       handle that responsibility.
    3. Implemented a set of commands (an a new hierarchy of commands) as first-class functions, which
       will be called by dbms-specific DatabaseIndexExtractor implementations.
       Before, these commands were developed at ad-hoc and were very difficult to read or extend.
       Now, there is a straightforward way for implementing new ones.
    4. Cleaned up several classes under the db package.
    5. started writing unit tests.
- started reviewing (in more detail) the Satuning's IBG package, so that I could start thinking of
  a good way to clean up the code under the package (what needs to be modified without breaking the
  existing functionality).
- met with Prof. Alkis to talk about what to read in order to catch up with terminology used in the
  automatic index tunning research and/or physical db tuning.
- started reading chapter 3 of Karl's thesis (Related Work section).
