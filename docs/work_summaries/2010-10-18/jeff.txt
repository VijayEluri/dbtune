-Created presentation info for our next meeting.

Divergent Index Design project work:
-Studied Amazon pricing and metrics for cloud machines
Amazon EC2 pricing, RDS pricing (reliable database service), new Read Replicas, storage pricing.
-Considered model for pricing with possibilities for DB replication to improved performance/cost
-Created wiki entries for potential Amazon systems and pricing
-Created spreadsheet to compute specific pricing for instances/storage/db on demand and reserved.
-Added graphs for on-demand vs. reserved instances pricing trends, and replication pricing trends using strong vs. weaker machines.

Meetings:
Alkis, Mariano Consens

Code:
Continued review of existing code base (just a little work here)

Other:
Damasc meetings with Joe + Noah for Hadoop over NetCDF
-2 long meetings
-formulated problem space and first solution attempt more directly
-discussed implementation details for first version

Next:
Continued work on new spreadsheet with simplified pricing and graphs.
Need to understand new PostgreSQL binary replication feature (hot standby DB), and how it might fit into our cloud replication cost/performance modeling.
